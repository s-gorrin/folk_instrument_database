# folk_instrument_database
This PostgreSQL database script was created as part of a structural database design class (BU MET CS669).

This represents the culmination of designing and implementing this database from scratch. There is relatively little data in it because all the data entry was done by hand.


Because of the use of the `BOOLEAN` data type, as well as the particular syntax of the procedures, this will only work with PostgreSQL.

Run the script to create and populate the database, and see some infomration by running the queries near the end.

## Structure
The full structure and fields of the database can be found in the DBMS physical ERD file.

## Charts
Some information from the database can be seen in the charts. This of course only reflects information in the database.

### Contents
All of the information contained here-in is publically accessible, but the people are real people, so their infomrmation
should be treated as such.
